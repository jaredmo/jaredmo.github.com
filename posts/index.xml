      <title>Can you teach ethics?</title>

      <description>CPAs across the country are required to sit through various amounts of ethics training every two years. I sat thought mine on Friday. Inevitably during these sessions, the question comes up, &amp;ldquo;Can ethics be taught?&amp;rdquo; My own answer to this question has fluctuated since it was first posed to me as a graduate student. Could more effective ethics training have prevented the major accounting failures of the last 10 years? I am, by nature and temperament, a realist.</description>

      <description>You may have noticed the blog posts have been in short supply since last year. Well, frankly, it&#39;s because I&#39;ve been a lot busier and the nature of my work has changed significantly. Instead of spending hours debugging code and writing the perfect formula in Excel, I&#39;m now delegating responsibilities and managing people. This has been an exciting and different world for me. As far as my plans for this blog, I&#39;m still going to post the odd technical tip as projects come up, but I may shift some focus to current accounting news and people management since that&#39;s where I am spending my time these days.</description>

      <description>I was working on a project this week that required aggregation of data from many, many different Excel workbooks (and various tabs within those workbooks) into one unified dashboard. Now, this can be accomplished with traditional linking, but anyone who has tried to link more than a few workbooks together will tell you this is a pain to maintain and often not very reliable.
One useful function for creating dynamic links within the same workbook is INDIRECT.</description>

      <description>I first heard about Bitcoin when Steve Gibson did a podcast on it a few months ago. Essentially, it&#39;s a medium of exchange just like any other currency. The major differences are 1. &amp;ldquo;coins&amp;rdquo; are simply bits in the system with no physical reality (actually, most of the US money supply has no physical reality either, but that&#39;s a post for another day), 2. transfers can&#39;t be traced, and 3. there is little to no transaction cost.</description>

      <description>Happy April Fools-Eve, my fellow practical joke connoisseurs. As someone who enjoys a good laugh at another&#39;s expense and also happens to be a bit of a geek, I thought would post the VBA code for two of my favorite Excel-based jokes. For those who aren&#39;t familiar with Visual Basic for Applications (&amp;ldquo;VBA&amp;rdquo;), it&#39;s a programming language that Microsoft created which allows users to customize the functionality of MS Office. For example, I have two macros setup which create hotkeys for Paste Values and Paste Formulas, since I use those on a daily basis.</description>

      <description>The Journal of Accountancy had a good article last month on building Excel-based dashboards. It got the creative juices flowing for me, and I am thinking about integrating some dashboards into my daily work. Modern BI tools like SAS and Business Objects can be used to automate feeds to predesigned Excel dashboards which can then be accessed by anyone over a shared network drive. The hardest (and most important) step is determining the appropriate metrics.</description>

      <description>Bill Gates gave a talk at TED this week that has generated quite a bit of buzz. The video is below. According to Gates, the major issue driving the underfunding of education is state pension obligations. Adding to the mix are governmental accounting standards which allow states to use unrealistic rates of return to discount the liability. Two University of Chicago economists have estimated that if more realistic rates were used the total unfunded pension liability for all US states changes from $310 billion to $2 trillion.</description>

      <description>“The most powerful force in the universe is compound interest” -Albert Einstein
My dad first taught me about compound interest when I was 18 years old. I was working for him, doing maintenance on our family&#39;s office building, and had some extra money burning a hole in my pocket. He wanted to teach me that there are better things to do with money than just blow it on music and video games (a tough argument for a teenager).</description>

      <description>Sometimes, I wonder where I fit on the career spectrum. I am trained as a CPA and 90% of my daily work involves accounting in some form. However, I am also a programmer who geeks out when I find a new way to automate processes or transform data into knowledge. My boss made a comment a few weeks ago in a meeting, “If you want to get Jared excited, ask him about two things: 1) His family or 2) SAS.</description>

      <description>Last week, I posted a tweet declaring that VLOOKUP (the popular joining function in Excel) was for newbs and that cool kids used MATCH and INDEX. I got some interesting responses, so I thought I would take a moment to defend my position and maybe gain some converts.
VLOOKUP in Action Essentially, both sets of functions are simple ways to join two tables that share a common field. Here&#39;s an example of VLOOKUP in action.</description>

      <description>Recently finished a book on the Great Depression called Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World. It was a 500+ page behemoth, but a surprisingly quick read. The story focuses on four central bankers during the 20s and 30s: Benjamin Strong of the Federal Reserve of New York, Montagu Norman of the Bank of England, Emile Morceau of the Banque de France, and Hjalmer Schacht of the Reichsbank of Germany.</description>

      <description>GigaOM had a good article this morning called Get Business Intelligence Ready for the Real-Time Web. Here&#39;s what they say BI 2.0 should look like. Not sure the tools exist yet to accomplish, but I can see things moving in this direction. Well designed dashboards do some of this already.
 The future of BI 2.0 will not rely on server power, but on the human power of the entire organization to capture everything, convert social media into tangible business objects, and automate real-time business processes.</description>

      <description>FASB released a report on November 29 with the unwieldy title &amp;ldquo;Progress Report on Commitment to Convergence of Accounting Standards and a Single Set of High Quality Global Accounting Standards&amp;rdquo;. Bottom line, FASB and IASB have reaffirmed their commitment to convergence. High priority projects are on track for a June 2011 completion date. The projects included in that designation are the following.
 Financial instruments Leases Revenue Recognition Consolidations Fair value measurement Derecognition Insurance Contracts  That pretty much covers, well, I don&#39;t know&amp;hellip;80%-90% of everything I&#39;ve ever learned about accounting.</description>

      <description>I received this same advice from a senior auditor in a performance review four years ago. It is some of the best career advice I&#39;ve ever received.
 When you&#39;re not sure what to do or how to proceed, don&#39;t start with a blank slate and ask for help. Instead, start with what you do know, state your intended direction (and rationale behind it) and then get the buy-in or feedback of your manager.</description>

      <description>Harvard Business Review had a good blog post this morning called On Creative Accounting: Two Creativity Myths. The term &amp;ldquo;creative accounting&amp;rdquo; conjures up images of Enron, and other massive financial reporting frauds. However, the author points out that creativity, itself, is morally neutral, and because creativity in accounting can be bad, that doesn&#39;t mean that it must be bad. Also, I liked the cartoon.</description>

      <description>Some economic predictions from a &amp;ldquo;strategic forecaster&amp;rdquo; named Pierce Snyder at an AICPA meeting in New Orleans. One can only hope that his prediction on government deleveraging (a nice way of saying debt retirement) is true. The others aren&#39;t really a huge shock but interesting nonetheless.
 Snyder listed seven economic inevitabilities for the next seven to eight years. Those are: * The entry-level labor pool will shrink by 5%. Workers 16 to 24 years old will be in short supply with intense competition among employers to attract this more tech-savvy generation.</description>

So, with that in mind, I am prepared to blow your mind with this post, pictures and all. Benford&#39;s Law. Who&#39;s heard of it? Anybody. Anybody. Bueller&amp;hellip;. This is Benford&#39;s Law.
What, equations don&#39;t do it for you? Well then, let&#39;s dive in. Benford&#39;s Law is one of those things that can be proven mathematically, but flies in the face of common sense.</description>

      <description>I found this picture in a pile of papers under my stairs and it reminded me of a fun memory so I thought I would share. While working at D&amp;amp;T, I was stationed for the better part of a year on one large client. During that period, I spent more time with those people than I did with my wife. We got to know each other well, and as would be expected with long hours and tough deadlines, some nicknames emerged.</description>

      <description>Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte did a great podcast this week regarding the Obama administration&#39;s proposed crypto-backdoor legislation. This is same issue Schneier discussed in his post from last week. Here are my takeaways.
 The technology for strong encryption already exists. It&#39;s math. Bad guys will still use it. Backdoor mandates will only hurt law abiding citizens. If this passes as requested by law enforcement, secure peer-to-peer communication would become illegal and the systems that support it subject to redesign.</description>

      <description>For those who&#39;ve never heard of him Bruce Schneier is a cryptography expert (notably created the Blowfish block cipher and Solitaire stream cipher). He authors a good blog on info security issues and recently had a post about Obama&#39;s internet wiretapping proposal. This is a bad idea for all sorts of reasons and Schneier does a good job outlining the risks. CPAs, especially those in IT audit functions, should pay attention to how this issue progresses as this could have substantial compliance ramifications for clients in all industries.</description>

Lots of issues were wrapped up in the questions this memo raised, but the bottom line was I needed to prove this new location would not hurt sales at an existing location where the company has a large stake.
I had customer level data for all our locations which included geolocation information (city, state, zip code, etc.</description>

      <description>Most of my daily life involves using numbers at work. However, numbers also have a significant role in my play. As a kid, I was a baseball card collector: bought them, traded them, memorized them. I think I liked baseball cards not for the personalities they represented, but because of the data on the back. All games involve numbers. Games of chance, games of skill: it doesn&#39;t really matter. Numbers are the way we measure performance.</description>

      <description>Most people wouldn&#39;t root for the IRS in a court case, but I&#39;m glad to see this decision. How long before we see &amp;ldquo;Grandson of BOSS&amp;rdquo; tax shelter schemes?
 The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has held that a taxpayer’s investment in a “Son of BOSS” tax shelter lacked economic substance and therefore did not generate deductible losses. This holding reverses a rare taxpayer win on the issue of Son of BOSS tax shelters in which a district court had allowed the taxpayer to deduct losses from the investment.</description>

      <description>The Commissioner of the IRS uses a paid preparer for his tax return…..Really?
 So, I ask again, what’s going on? Here’s one possibility: Over the years, the government turned the tax code over to technical experts, who wrote the regulations, forms, and processes in their own language without regard for the end-user, the citizen, who would be required to use them. As the language and process became more and more arcane, fewer end-users could actually do their own taxes, so an industry of “tax preparers” formed to provide an interface between the tax payer and the taxing authorities.</description>

      <description>Recently, I have been getting out my comfort zone with SAS/SQL and expanding into the world of Visual Basic. For those unfamiliar, Visual Basic for Applications (or VBA) is Microsoft’s language which allows users to customize Microsoft Office. It is especially useful in Access and Excel. A simple example of VBA would be an Excel macro. When a user records a macro, the steps are recorded as VBA code and mapped to a keyboard shortcut.</description>

      <description>For Part II in this series of posts on DO Loops in SAS, I wanted to discuss an application slightly more complex than the previous example. Loops can not only be used to perform data correction (as shown in the previous post), but can also be very useful in creating new records where none exist. We’ll discuss using order data again as our example. Your client would like you to create a daily trend report showing YTD Quantity Sold by Product by Date.</description>

      <description>DO Loops in SAS are outside the scope of what most beginning users feel comfortable tackling. However, they are a powerful, time-saving tool in the report writer’s toolbox. For those unfamiliar with programming, loops are a set of instructions that the programmer tells the computer to repeat until predefined condition(s) are true. It’s a simple concept but powerful in execution.
To illustrate, here is an example of where a loop might be used.</description>

      <description>When individuals outside the profession think of accounting, they don&#39;t often consider its subjective nature. Most people assume there are bright line rules and it&#39;s the CPA&#39;s job to make sure the rules are adhered to. In some instances, there is exact guidance (which makes our lives easier), but in many others CPAs are required to make estimates. Estimates being a nice way of saying, &amp;ldquo;Mr. CPA, please attempt to predict the future.</description>

      <description>Listened to a podcast this afternoon from &amp;ldquo;This American Life&amp;rdquo; entitled &amp;ldquo;Return to the Giant Pool of Money&amp;rdquo;. The series&amp;rsquo; first episode contains the best explanation of last fall&#39;s financial meltdown I have heard. The &amp;ldquo;return&amp;rdquo; was equally informative. While the podcast contained interviews with many different players, the most interesting character, in my opinion, was Glen.
Glen was a mortgage company sales manager during the boom. He stated in the first part of the series that during the good times he was netting upwards of 75-100K per month in income.</description>

      <title>Excel &#34;Protect Sheet&#34; Hack</title>

      <description>I had a situation yesterday where I was trying to get into a password protected Excel sheet and did not know the password. After a quick Google search I realized that the &amp;ldquo;Protect Sheet&amp;rdquo; function in Excel has a backdoor which can be exploited with a few lines of VBA. I didn&#39;t write the code below, but I am not ashamed to use it.
The algorithm relies on a backdoor password that can be 1 to 9 characters long where each character is either an &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; except the last which can be any character from ASCII code 32 to 255.</description>

      <description>It is always nice to read an article like this about your profession. Robert Half International has come up with these salary estimates for the following accounting/finance positions in 2008.
  Internal auditor. National average starting salaries for internal audit managers at large companies (more than $250 million in sales) are expected to climb 6.7 percent in 2008, to a range of $81,500 to $109,500 annually.

      <description>I recently finished a book on the Enron scandal entitled, &amp;ldquo;The Smartest Guys in the Room.&amp;quot; It was a fantastic book and, for the accounting geeks, had good descriptions of the related party transactions that Enron used to prop up their earnings during the late 90s. The SPEs had really fun names like Chewco and Jedi and Whitewing. Inside, I think Fastow must have been a Star Wars fanboy. Amidst all the accounting and structured finance shenanigans, there was a paragraph from an employee that summarized the entire meltdown.</description>

      <description>I enjoy numbers. I like adding them and subtracting them, moving them around and finding patterns. This is a blog about that. I am a CPA so I will occasionally throw in my thoughts on the profession. Hopefully it will be somewhat insightful and not completely narcissistic. Happy reading.</description>
