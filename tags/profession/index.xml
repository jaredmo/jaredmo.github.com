      <description>CPAs across the country are required to sit through various amounts of ethics training every two years. I sat thought mine on Friday. Inevitably during these sessions, the question comes up, &amp;ldquo;Can ethics be taught?&amp;rdquo; My own answer to this question has fluctuated since it was first posed to me as a graduate student. Could more effective ethics training have prevented the major accounting failures of the last 10 years? I am, by nature and temperament, a realist.</description>

      <description>You may have noticed the blog posts have been in short supply since last year. Well, frankly, it&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;ve been a lot busier and the nature of my work has changed significantly. Instead of spending hours debugging code and writing the perfect formula in Excel, I&amp;rsquo;m now delegating responsibilities and managing people. This has been an exciting and different world for me. As far as my plans for this blog, I&amp;rsquo;m still going to post the odd technical tip as projects come up, but I may shift some focus to current accounting news and people management since that&amp;rsquo;s where I am spending my time these days.</description>

      <description>Much of the discussion surrounding the Occupy Wall Street protest movement has turned towards the rising costs of higher education. This is likely because many of the protesters are young, college educated and saddled with enormous federal debt. The Los Angeles Times had a piece this weekend discussing the issue. It was good article, but I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed something missing in all the coverage. Something that colleges, students and even parents don&amp;rsquo;t seem to want to talk about.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, I wonder where I fit on the career spectrum. I am trained as a CPA and 90% of my daily work involves accounting in some form. However, I am also a programmer who geeks out when I find a new way to automate processes or transform data into knowledge. My boss made a comment a few weeks ago in a meeting, â€œIf you want to get Jared excited, ask him about two things: 1) His family or 2) SAS.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I believe managing is like holding a dove in your hand. If you hold it too tightly you kill it, but if you hold it too loosely, you lose it.&amp;rdquo; -Tommy Lasorda
There is an art to managing well. I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first to admit I am still learning. As I have been given positions of leadership, one of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to do is look back on leaders I admire for traits to emulate.</description>
