      <description>Two years ago, I wrote a long post about the Stanford International Bank Fraud.
I recently thought about the story and realized I never followed up to see what happened. After a quick Google search, I was pleased to see that Allen Stanford was convicted and sentenced to 110 years in prison.
The most amazing part is even after his conviction Stanford still claims he wasn&amp;rsquo;t running a Ponzi scheme and the government is responsible for his victims&#39; losses.</description>

      <description>While Bernie Madoff was busy having his face shown all over the news last year, a smaller but equally devastating Ponzi scheme was discovered by federal authorities: Standford International Bank (&amp;ldquo;SIB&amp;rdquo;). Because of the dollars involved in Madoff&amp;rsquo;s scam ($65 billion), the Stanford fraud ($7.2 billion) didn&amp;rsquo;t get much press coverage. However, for the victims of this fraud, the outcome may be worse.
Stanford International Bank was started in 1986 by Allen Stanford.</description>
