      <description>Bill Gates gave a talk at TED this week that has generated quite a bit of buzz. The video is below. According to Gates, the major issue driving the underfunding of education is state pension obligations. Adding to the mix are governmental accounting standards which allow states to use unrealistic rates of return to discount the liability. Two University of Chicago economists have estimated that if more realistic rates were used the total unfunded pension liability for all US states changes from $310 billion to $2 trillion.</description>

      <description>FASB released a report on November 29 with the unwieldy title &amp;ldquo;Progress Report on Commitment to Convergence of Accounting Standards and a Single Set of High Quality Global Accounting Standards&amp;rdquo;. Bottom line, FASB and IASB have reaffirmed their commitment to convergence. High priority projects are on track for a June 2011 completion date. The projects included in that designation are the following.
 Financial instruments Leases Revenue Recognition Consolidations Fair value measurement Derecognition Insurance Contracts  That pretty much covers, well, I don&#39;t know&amp;hellip;80%-90% of everything I&#39;ve ever learned about accounting.</description>

      <description>When individuals outside the profession think of accounting, they don&#39;t often consider its subjective nature. Most people assume there are bright line rules and it&#39;s the CPA&#39;s job to make sure the rules are adhered to. In some instances, there is exact guidance (which makes our lives easier), but in many others CPAs are required to make estimates. Estimates being a nice way of saying, &amp;ldquo;Mr. CPA, please attempt to predict the future.</description>

      <description>I recently finished a book on the Enron scandal entitled, &amp;ldquo;The Smartest Guys in the Room.&amp;quot; It was a fantastic book and, for the accounting geeks, had good descriptions of the related party transactions that Enron used to prop up their earnings during the late 90s. The SPEs had really fun names like Chewco and Jedi and Whitewing. Inside, I think Fastow must have been a Star Wars fanboy. Amidst all the accounting and structured finance shenanigans, there was a paragraph from an employee that summarized the entire meltdown.</description>
